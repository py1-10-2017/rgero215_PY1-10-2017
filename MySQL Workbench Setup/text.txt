On terminal I run mysql using this command $brew services start mysql
then open MySQL Workbench settings to check the hostname, port and user name.
To change the port I create a file named my.cnf and add the following text:

[client]
port = 3307
[mysqld]
port = 3307

And save the file in this dir: /etc/my.cnf and restart the server:
$ brew services restart mysql

To import a file to MySQL Workbench I just open the file and copy, paste and run the file on the editor.
To use a specific database within the editor we run the following command:
USE [database name] 
USE twitter
SELECT first_name, last_name, tweets.tweet
FROM users
LEFT JOIN tweets
ON users.id = tweets.user_id;
